# RNWorkshop - React Native workshop

## Setting up your environment and creating a new project
See https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

## Running the app in the iOS simulator
- Open Xcode
- Click "Open another project..." on the bottom right
- Browse to your project, select the .xcworkspace file in the ios folder and open it
- Choose a target device (I recommend the iPhone 11 because it has the notch and we want to be sure we account for it)
- Press the play button on the top left of XCode. The first compile and launching the simulator will be slow.
- The app should launch in the similator

## Your first component and rendering to the screen + basic styling
- `git checkout gh-1-first-component`
